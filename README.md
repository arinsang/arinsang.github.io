Hello! My name is Arin Sang and I am originally from Princeton, New Jersey. I am currently a first year student at Lehigh University in the School of Arts and Sciences and plan to major in economics/political science. 

This page was created to explore new avenues of my Data Journalism class. I took this class to learn more about how information is processed and communicated! Although I consider myself more of a humanities person, I am excited to delve deeper into the technical side of this field as we live in such a data-driven world today.
