Hello! My name is Arin Sang and I am originally from Princeton, New Jersey. I am currently a first year student at Lehigh University in the School of Arts and Sciences and plan to major in economics/political science. 

This page was created to explore new avenues of my Data Journalism class. I took this class to learn more about how information is processed and communicated! Although I consider myself more of a humanities person, I am excited to delve deeper into the technical side of this field as we live in such a data-driven world today.

Lehigh University's Student Enrollment, although on the smaller scale, brings a well balanced group of students. The university primarily consists of undergraduates.

[Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/02/07/6-facts-about-economic-inequality-in-the-u-s/)
Income inequality is a pressing issue that seems to grow stronger everyday in the U.S. The Gini index measures wealth distribution across a population, with zero representing total equality and 1 representing total inequality, where all wealth is concentrated in a single household. The indicator has been rising steadily for several decades and although the gap between the richest and poorest income brackets have expanded, the nation’s median household income increased. However, when taking inflation into consideration, it’s roughly the same as it was 20 years ago. Additionally, we can also see racial trends.
