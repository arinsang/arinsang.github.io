Hello! My name is Arin Sang and I am originally from Princeton, New Jersey. I am currently a first year student at Lehigh University in the School of Arts and Sciences and plan to major in economics/political science.This page was created to explore new avenues of my Data Journalism class. I took this class to learn more about how information is processed and communicated! Although I consider myself more of a humanities person, I am excited to delve deeper into the technical side of this field as we live in such a data-driven world today.

Lehigh University's Student Enrollment, although on the smaller scale, brings a well balanced group of students. The university primarily consists of undergraduates.

## U.S. Income Inequality

[Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/02/07/6-facts-about-economic-inequality-in-the-u-s/)
Income inequality is a pressing issue that seems to grow stronger everyday in the U.S. The Gini index measures wealth distribution across a population, with zero representing total equality and 1 representing total inequality, where all wealth is concentrated in a single household. The indicator has been rising steadily for several decades and although the gap between the richest and poorest income brackets have expanded, the nation’s median household income increased. However, when taking inflation into consideration, it’s roughly the same as it was 20 years ago. Additionally, we can also see racial trends.

# Bar Chart Project 
![chart](https://github.com/arinsang/arinsang.github.io/blob/master/U.S._Median_Household_Income_based_on_Racial_Demographics_2019_Median_Income_(dollars)_Estimate_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)

As seen from the graph above, Asian-Americans have the highest median household income at $98,174 and closely follows White-Americans (both hispanic and not) at an average of $74,130.50. Meanwhile, the African-American community's median household income is at $45,438, which lies significantly behind any other racial group. African Americans are the only racial group the Census Bureau identifies that has not seen significant income gains over the past few years compared to other racial counterparts. Median household income means half of U.S. households earn more and half earn less and is an important indicator of the economic health of the middle class. Evidently, such trends reveal the struggle for Black Americans to move up the economic ladder-- employment playing a large role in this. Merely having an “African American sounding name” makes an employer less likely to hire someone, a National Bureau of Economic Research study found. The study noted that even when African Americans attend college and actively work to expand their skills and networks, they still earn far less than whites with a similar educational background.

According to [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/the-13-fastest-growing-economies-in-the-world/slidelist/47644185.cms#slideid=47644186), these are the top 13 countries that are slowly, but undeniably, claiming their spots as strong global economies today. This growth is attributed to several reasons, but mostly due to their optimization and use of natural resources.

Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey, all had steadily decreasing rates of unemployment from September 2010 to September 2019. However, in 2020, there was a sharp increase in unemployment; given the current circumstances of SARS COVID-19, the rates continue to skyrocket.

The data above reinforces the idea of Lehigh University students' partying habits. Most of which are concentrated in the presence of greek life that make up majority of the student body, both male and female students.

[Data: U.S. Census](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/tables/geographic-mobility/time-series/historic/tab-a-5.xls) 

The data above depicts the causes of geographic mobility in the U.S. 
Two of the components consist of being evicted out or due to finding new employment in another location. As seen, the rate at which people move due to being evicted is, on average at about 10%, notably less in most recent years than previously. The peak at which people moved because of this reason was between 2011-2013. Compared these housing related causes just mentioned, the data portraying migration due to new employment did not fluctuate as much-- or even as significantly at all in its isolated view. The reason for migrating due to new employment ranges from about 4.2% to 6.5%. It is notably at its lowest percentage during 2008 most likely due to the great U.S. economic recession. Some data implications may be present due to the misalignment of time ranges between housing related and employment related causes.
