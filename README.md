Hello! My name is Arin Sang and I am originally from Princeton, New Jersey. I am currently a first year student at Lehigh University in the School of Arts and Sciences and plan to major in economics/political science.This page was created to explore new avenues of my Data Journalism class. I took this class to learn more about how information is processed and communicated! Although I consider myself more of a humanities person, I am excited to delve deeper into the technical side of this field as we live in such a data-driven world today.

## U.S. Income Inequality

[Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/02/07/6-facts-about-economic-inequality-in-the-u-s/)
Income inequality is a pressing issue that seems to grow stronger everyday in the U.S. The Gini index measures wealth distribution across a population, with zero representing total equality and 1 representing total inequality, where all wealth is concentrated in a single household. The indicator has been rising steadily for several decades and although the gap between the richest and poorest income brackets have expanded, the nation’s median household income increased. However, when taking inflation into consideration, it’s roughly the same as it was 20 years ago. Additionally, we can also see racial trends.

When hearing the term "economic recession," many Americans are quick to refer to the Great Depression of the 1930s. The Great Depression, a worldwide economic depression attributed to the U.S. stock market failure, impacted millions of people and sparked fundamental changes in economic institutions, macroeconomic policy, and economic theory. The lasting effects can still be felt even in today's industrialized modern world. However, the endurance and overcoming of such a historical disaster did not prevent other economic recessions from occuring. In the 2000s, the United States continued to experience its fair share of economic challenges. Subsequently met with government initiatives to counteract these unfortunate circumstances. Above is a timeline of the major economic events.

As seen from the graph above, Asian-Americans have the highest median household income at $98,174 and closely follows White-Americans (both hispanic and not) at an average of $74,130.50. Meanwhile, the African-American community's median household income is at $45,438, which lies significantly behind any other racial group. African Americans are the only racial group the Census Bureau identifies that has not seen significant income gains over the past few years compared to other racial counterparts. Median household income means half of U.S. households earn more and half earn less and is an important indicator of the economic health of the middle class. Evidently, such trends reveal the struggle for Black Americans to move up the economic ladder-- employment playing a large role in this. Merely having an “African American sounding name” makes an employer less likely to hire someone, a National Bureau of Economic Research study found. The study noted that even when African Americans attend college and actively work to expand their skills and networks, they still earn far less than whites with a similar educational background. 



# Fastest Growing World Economies (2017)

According to [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/the-13-fastest-growing-economies-in-the-world/slidelist/47644185.cms#slideid=47644186), these are the top 13 countries that are slowly, but undeniably, claiming their spots as strong global economies today based on 2017 GDP data. This growth is attributed to several reasons, but mostly due to their optimization and use of natural resources.

# Time Series Chart
![chart](https://github.com/arinsang/arinsang.github.io/blob/master/State_Unemployment_Rates,_September_2010_to_September_2020_New_Jersey_Pennsylvania_New_York_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)

Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey, all had steadily decreasing rates of unemployment from September 2010 to September 2019. However, in 2020, there was a sharp increase in unemployment; given the current circumstances of SARS COVID-19, the rates continue to skyrocket. Millions of U.S. workers have already lost their jobs as nonessential businesses are forced to close to comply with social distancing restrictions. While many of these workers have already applied for unemployment benefits, the new law explicitly states their eligibility and many have argued how difficult it was to obtain these benefits. It is likely that these unfortunate and last effects of the pandemic will proceed long after it is deemed to be "over." The question of how governing bodies will further address these pressing issues can be seen to be highly politicized between the American public.

[Data: U.S. Census](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/tables/geographic-mobility/time-series/historic/tab-a-5.xls) 

The data above depicts the causes of geographic mobility in the U.S. 
Two of the components consist of being evicted out or due to finding new employment in another location. As seen, the rate at which people move due to being evicted is, on average at about 10%, notably less in most recent years than previously. The peak at which people moved because of this reason was between 2011-2013. Compared these housing related causes just mentioned, the data portraying migration due to new employment did not fluctuate as much-- or even as significantly at all in its isolated view. The reason for migrating due to new employment ranges from about 4.2% to 6.5%. It is notably at its lowest percentage during 2008 most likely due to the great U.S. economic recession. Some data implications may be present due to the misalignment of time ranges between housing related and employment related causes.
